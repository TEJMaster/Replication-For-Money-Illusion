Introduction
Money illusion is a cognitive bias in which there is a tendency to think about
money in face value of a currency that changes with inflation (nominal terms) rather
than the value of a product minus existing inflation (real terms), thus disregarding the
impact of inflation on the (real) value of money (Shafir et al., 1997). Significant
consequences result from this effect, such as hesitancy in selling a house when a
nominal loss appears apparent but, in reality, it means a real gain or a
misinterpretation of a nominal wage increase as a wage cut.
Shafir and colleagues' seminal 1997 article, which elucidates the money
illusion effect, has significantly influenced the fields of economic psychology and
behavioral economics, garnering over 1,242 citations on Google Scholar by 2023.
The authors proposed that money illusion could explain rigid wages and contracts, in
direct contrast to economic models that postulate full rationality in agents, such as
the quantitative theory of money (Akerlof et al., 1996). Moreover, this phenomenon
was suggested to be present in different financial situations, such as employers who
apply increases of payment below the inflation rate to maintain workers more
satisfied (Fisher, 1928/2011). In the presence of money illusion, individuals tend to
consider money in nominal rather than real terms, resulting in a practical rather than
theoretical approach to adjust to malleable and changing inflation. This phenomenon
is described as “nominal inertia”, as proposed by Fehr & Tyran (2001). Despite its
widespread citation and application across various fields, the original study has not
yet received consistent and direct replication. As of now, there has been only one
such attempt, in which Ziano and colleagues (2021) conducted a replication study
with very close results to the original study.
As hypotheses, we predict the presence of the money illusion effect across all
four problems, as follows: in Problem 1, individuals may perceive workers as less
content with a job and more inclined to resign when offered a larger wage increase in
real terms, despite it being smaller in nominal terms; in Problem 2, individuals would
rank the best deals among three house sellers based on nominal gains, instead of
real gains; in Problem 3, participants may be less likely to buy the armchair, and
more likely to sell it, even when the price increase is only nominal; and in Problem 4,
individuals might opt for risky contracts in real terms over riskless ones in nominal
terms in a computer purchase problem. could you please help me to paraphrase these paragraph?

Sure, here's a paraphrased version:

Introduction

Money illusion refers to a cognitive bias where individuals tend to assess the value of money solely based on its nominal, rather than real, value, thereby overlooking the impact of inflation. This bias can lead to various consequences, such as reluctance to sell assets due to perceived nominal losses, misunderstanding wage increases, and more.

The influential 1997 study by Shafir and colleagues, which introduced the concept of money illusion, has significantly impacted economic psychology and behavioral economics. It has been widely cited and discussed in academic literature. The authors argued that money illusion could explain phenomena like inflexible wages and contracts, contrary to traditional economic theories assuming rationality in decision-making.

Moreover, this bias is believed to manifest in various financial scenarios, such as employers offering wage increases below the inflation rate to maintain worker satisfaction. Individuals tend to focus on nominal rather than real terms, resulting in what's termed "nominal inertia." Despite its widespread application, the original study has not been consistently replicated, with only one attempt so far yielding similar results.

We hypothesize that across all four problems: individuals will perceive wage increases differently depending on whether they are presented in nominal or real terms; individuals will evaluate house deals based on nominal gains rather than real gains; participants will be less likely to purchase items when prices increase nominally; and individuals might prefer riskier contracts in real terms over safer options presented in nominal terms.
